A group project website containing entertainment options for everyone.
The group leader decided to use a template to help speed up development and ensure that each page was cohesive.
The original design was updated to increase readability and allow more entertainment options to be displayed.

# The team was assigned tasks to complete.
- Addition of header image
- Scrollablility of additional entertainment options
- Feedback page
- Additional content

# Personal Accomplishments
- Found and used a Jquery Plugin to achieve scrolling of multiple entertainment options
- Created a CSS slider using images to look like a movie film strip on the homepage
- Fixed a bug that would not allow for transparent backgrounds on links due to the template's stylesheet
-  Worked with a team to create and complete a project

# Issues
- Everyone on the team did not contribute equally
- A white background behind links due to using the template (fixed)
- CSS slider glitches as images move across the screen (downside of this technology)
- Colors chosen to improve readability do not render the same on every display
